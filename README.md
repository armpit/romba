# ROMba

ROMba is a command-line tool (and WEB shell) for the management, and collection of ROMs and DAT files within the Linux and Mac OS X environments.
While its core functionalty is similar to tools like ROMVault and CLRMamePRO that were designed for the Microsoft Windows environment, ROMba takes a unique approach by storing ROMs in a de-duplicated way, and allowing you to "build" any set you need on demand.
